# HTML5 Boilerplate For Facebook Apps

This is a fork of the HTML5 Boilerplate, with modifications for Facebook Apps/Tabs. Uses LESS CSS.

## Additions

* Convenience [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) inserts and mixins
* [HTC.pie](http://css3pie.com/)  
  Add CSS3 Properties to IE6-9. Please check known issues if you have any problems  
	Please check out ./less/mixins.php to set the proper path for HTC.pie if necessary.
